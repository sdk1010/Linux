# Linux Learning

## What is Linux???

Linux® is an open source operating system (OS). 
An operating system is the software that directly manages a system’s hardware and resources, like CPU, memory, and storage. 
The OS sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work.
Linux is a Unix-like, open source and community-developed operating system (OS) for computers, servers, mainframes, mobile devices and embedded devices. 
It is supported on almost every major computer platform, including x86, ARM and SPARC, making it one of the most widely supported operating systems.

## How is the Linux operating system used???

Every version of the Linux OS manages hardware resources, launches and handles applications, and provides some form of user interface. 
The enormous community for developers and wide range of distributions means that a Linux version is available for almost any task, and Linux has penetrated many areas of computing.
For example, Linux has emerged as a popular OS for web servers such as Apache, as well as for network operations, scientific computing tasks that require huge compute clusters, running databases, desktop and endpoint computing, and running mobile devices with OS versions like Android.

## Linux Distributions::

Hundreds of different Linux versions, also known as distributions or distros, are available. 
Distributions usually distinguish themselves from the pack by addressing a specific goal, philosophy, function or target market.
Linux distributions may be community-developed, like Debian, Slackware and Gentoo. 
Other distributions are commercial and intended for enterprise use, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. 
Many distributions use a combination of community- and corporate-supported development, such as Red Hat's Fedora, openSUSE from SUSE and Ubuntu from Canonical.
